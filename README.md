# AIDA-SkillGraph
This project introduces two distinct systems that utilize the same foundational
data (SUA documents): an AI-driven chatbot platform and a comprehensive
graph mapping. Both tools are designed to independently streamline the data
retrieval process in the educational landscape, particularly for university students and stakeholders.
The AI platform, based on Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5,
leverages its impressive capabilities for text comprehension and generation to
deliver accurate, context-specific academic information. It allows students to
explore various degree programs offered by Italian universities, making this academic information accessible and user-friendly.
On the other hand, the graph tool provides a mapping of skills offered by
each Italian university degree program. This is aligned with the European Skills,
Competencies, qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) framework, helping students comprehend the potential career paths associated with their academic
choices.
Both the use of LLMs in the chatbot and the graph database aim to support
how students and stakeholders access and understand university-related information, thereby empowering them to make informed academic decisions that
align with their long-term career objectives. Through this potent combination,
students are granted a valuable resource offering insights into the practical applications of their chosen fields of study.
